## Summary

The authors introduce Margin Trader, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed for margin trading in the stock market, addressing a gap in existing portfolio management approaches that primarily focus on cash-only trading. Margin Trader incorporates margin accounts and their constraints, particularly for short sales, into a realistic trading environment for both long and short positions. The framework balances profit maximization and risk management through its Margin Adjustment and Maintenance Detection Modules. Supporting various Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, it allows customization of settings like equity allocation and margin ratios. Experimental results show that Margin Trader outperforms other models with the highest Sharpe ratio by learning profitable strategies and managing risks in different market conditions.
