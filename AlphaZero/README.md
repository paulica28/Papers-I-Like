# AlphaZero Connect 4 (Toy Implementation)

This repository contains a toy implementation of AlphaZero applied to the classic game of Connect 4. AlphaZero is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm designed by DeepMind, and it has been famously used to master games such as Chess, Go, and Shogi. In this project, we bring a simplified version of AlphaZero to the popular Connect 4 game.

## Summary

The game of chess has been a key area of study in artificial intelligence, with top programs traditionally relying on complex search methods, domain-specific tweaks, and evaluation functions crafted by human experts. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program achieved superhuman performance in Go using only reinforcement learning from self-play. This paper extends that approach into a general AlphaZero algorithm that, starting from random play and using no prior knowledge other than game rules, achieved superhuman performance in chess, shogi, and Go within 24 hours, defeating world-champion programs in each case.
