## Summary

This paper introduces a novel approach for predicting stock prices using a Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE). The approach addresses the stochastic nature of multi-step regression problems by incorporating diffusion processes into the model architecture. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of D-VAE in forecasting stock prices.
