## Summary

The authors present a framework for continuous-depth graph neural networks (GNNs). They formalize graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) as a counterpart to traditional GNNs, where the input-output relationship is governed by a continuous sequence of GNN layers, integrating discrete topological structures with differential equations. The framework is demonstrated to be compatible with various static and autoregressive GNN models. The results highlight the general effectiveness of GDEs: in static settings, they offer computational benefits by incorporating numerical methods in their forward pass, while in dynamic settings, they enhance performance by leveraging the geometry of the underlying dynamics.
